          The Olympic Games are an international sports festival, held every
          four years. The ultimate goals are to cultivate human beings, through
          sport, and contribute to world peace. Summer Games and Winter Games
          are held separately.

        <h4>
               
          The history of the Olympics began some 2,300 years ago. Their origin
          lays in the Olympian Games, which were held in the Olympia area of
          ancient Greece. Although there are some theories on its initial
          purposes, the Games have been said to have started as a festival of
          art and sport, to worship gods. The ancient Olympic Games, however,
          ended in 393 because of the outbreaks of wars in the region in which
          they were held.

        <h4>
          After a 1,500 year absence of the ancient Olympic Games, the event was
          resumed in the late nineteenth century, thanks to the efforts of Baron
          Pierre de Coubertin, a French educator. In 1894, his proposal to
          revive the Olympic Games was unanimously approved at the International
          Congress in Paris, and the first Olympic Games were held in Athens,
          Greece, two years later. He also devised the five-ring emblem that is
          familiar to most people as the Games’ symbol, which represents the
          unity of the five continents.

          The founder of the International Olympic Committee was Baron Pierre de
          Coubertin, a French educator who reformed education and sports in
          France. His dream of revitalizing ancient Olympics in the modern-day
          had its roots back in the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889 where he
          organized the first-ever Congress on Physical Education and Scholar
          Competition. The very next year, he met the founder of Wenlock Games,
          Dr. William Penny Brooks. Wenlock Games also known as British Olympics
          started in 1866 was a huge success and Coubertin’s idea of reviving
          the Olympics was seconded by Brooks. Coubertin had great hopes on his
          idea and he set the big date on November 25, 1892, to announce his
          dream of having the international sporting festival. He delivered a
          speech proposing the return of the Olympic Games at the Union des
          Sports Athletiques in Paris but the audience wasn’t convinced. But he
          didn’t give up. On June 23, 1984, Coubertin invited 79 sports
          delegates from 49 organizations across nine countries to a Congress at
          Sorbonne and created the International Olympic Committee. The first
          two Olympic Games were also announced that day, the 1896 Olympics at
          Paris and the 1900 Olympics at Greece. Demetrius Vikelas of Greece was
          selected as the first IOC president.

          The interlocking rings of the Olympic flag was created by Baron Pierre
          de Coubertin, the co-founder of the modern Olympic games. The five
          rings represented the five participating continents of the time:
          Africa, Asia, America, Europe, and Oceania. While the colors of the
          five rings, blue, yellow, black, green, and red together with the
          white background of the flag could compose the colors of every
          nation’s flag at the time of its inception as the official Olympic
          symbol in 1915. This is what the inventor, Baron Pierre de Coubertin,
          had to say about his Olympic symbol in 1931.Going from left to right,
          the five colors for the Olympic rings are blue, yellow, black, green
          and red. Contrary to popular belief, the five colors of the Olympic
          rings do not directly correspond to given continents. Instead, the
          five colors (along with white, which is the background color of the
          Olympic flag) were chosen because at least one of those colors
          appeared on the national flag of each country participating at the
          time Coubertin came up with the design.

          The IOC is at the center of the world sporting arena. It supports
          every Olympic Movement stakeholder, promoting the spirit of Olympism
          globally, and monitors the regular celebration & organization of the
          Olympic Games. The IOC is also committed to encouraging the sport in
          society, strengthening the integrity of sport, and supporting
          sportspersons and organizations associated with them.These include:
          1.1 Respect for the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual
          understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play;
          1.2 Respect of the principle of the universality and political
          neutrality of the Olympic Movement; 1.3 Maintaining harmonious
          relations with state authorities, while respecting the principle of
          autonomy as set out in the Olympic Charter; 1.4 Respect for
          international conventions on protecting human rights insofar as they
          apply to the Olympic Games’ activities and which ensure in particular:
          – respect for human dignity; – rejection of discrimination of any kind
          on whatever grounds, be it race, colour, sex, sexual orientation,
          language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social
          origin, property, birth or other status; – rejection of all forms of

        <h4>
          The three fundamental values of Olympism are excellence, friendship,
          and respect. They constitute the foundation on which the Olympic
          Movement builds its activities to promote sport, culture, and
          education with a view to building a better world. The original values
          of Olympism as expressed in the Olympic Charter were to “encourage
          effort”, “preserve human dignity” and “develop harmony”. Over time,
          they have evolved and are now expressed in more contemporary terms as:
          Striving for excellence and encouraging people to be the best they can
          be. Celebrating friendship, which is quite unique to the Olympic Games
          – an event that brings people together every few years. Demonstrating
          respect in many different manners: respect towards yourself, the
          rules, your opponents, the environment, the public, etc.

          Olympism, the spirit of the Olympic Games advocated by Coubertin, is
          “The elevation of the mind and soul, overcoming differences between
          nationalities and cultures, embracing friendship, a sense of
          solidarity, and fair play; ultimately leading to the contribution
          towards world peace and the betterment of the world. “ This philosophy
          has been passed down, unchanged, to this day, so Coubertin is
          considered to be the “Father of the modern Olympics”. Since the word
          “environment” was recently added to “sports” and “culture” as a theme
          of the Games, the Olympics have also provided an opportunity for
          people to consider the global environment. In these Games, the
          excitement and emotions generated by the athletes, together with the
          environmental themes, will unite people across the world.
